# My stock tracker.

### Intro & Context
This is my solution to the coding challenge. This App is a weather app that allows the
user to see the current weather for a specific location.

## Initial Setup

### Environment setup

Please make sure to have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download) 18 up installed.


### Running the code

Nothing changes, you can run `yarn` or `npm install` to install dependencies.
After that, you can run:

```bash
# npm
npm run dev

# or yarn
yarn dev
```

After running the above command, you can see the client application running in your browser by going to http://localhost:8080.
